# Learn-GitHub

This README file describes what Learn-GitHub repository is for, and how to use it.
So this is the repository where we can play around and learn how to use GitHub PROPERLY.
We can refer to the pdf "Version Control with GitHub" shared on Google Drive to get a hand on the main functions available in Git. 

Some rules of thumb for this repository (and probably all repositories for that matter):

# 1: if you want to make changes, create a new branch! 
# 2: if you commit your changes, add a (USEFUL) comment
# 3: can't think of other rule for now.
